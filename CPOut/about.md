The script in its current stage will need to be placed in a folder in the same level with the a folder named “CPOut”, which contains CellProfiler output.

The script will also look for files named “DefaultDB_train.db” and “DefaultDB_test.db” , which are SQLite databases, inside “CPOut”. Please consider this if you need to change the name and type of CellProfiler output.

If you wish, you can change these path and names easily by editing the script itself using any text editor.
